# Data Structures Succintly, Part 1

This repository contains implementations of data structures from Robert
Hovick's Data Structures Succintly Part 1 \[1\] in Python, in place of C# as used in
the book. I'll skip over any that don't make sense to implement in Python, such
as the ArrayList, since Python doesn't expose fixed-length arrays in the
traditional sense of the term.
